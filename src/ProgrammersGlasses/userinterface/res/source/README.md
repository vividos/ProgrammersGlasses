# Sources

This folder contains the source files for the bitmaps used in the app. They
all come from the Visual Studio 2022 image gallery zip archive. The original
names of the `.svg` files are used.

The `GenerateImages.cmd` command script can be used to (re-)generate the
images. You need to have the program ImageMagick installed somewhere (the
portable version will do). Set the program's path in the `.cmd` file and run
it. Bitmaps for all DPI resolutions will be generated.
